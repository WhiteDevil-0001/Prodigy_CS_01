- Input any positive/negative integer as the shift value.
- Non-alphabet characters remain unchanged.
- User-friendly command-line interface.
- User-friendly graphical user interface.

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/WhiteDevil-0001/Prodigy_CS_01.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    cd Prodigy_CS_01

3. Run the Python script:
    ``` For command-line interface ```
    python caesar_cipher_CLI.py

    ``` For graphical user interface ```
    python caesar_cipher_GUI.py

4. Follow the prompts to encrypt or decrypt messages.

    ``` Example ```
